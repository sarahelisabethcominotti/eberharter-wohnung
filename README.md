# Apartment Eberharter Website

First client project for an apartment owner. The webstie was built with CMS Hygraph for easier management of the content and deployed to Netlify. 

The main language was Javascript with React and styling in CSS. It features a toggle that lets you select language between English or German and a contact form that sends and email directly to the client.
